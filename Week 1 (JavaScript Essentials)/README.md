<summary>1. Importance of JavaScript?</summary>

- JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.

- In web browsers, JavaScript consists of three main parts:

          1. Core JS: ECMAScript provides the core functionality.

          2. DOM: The Document Object Model (DOM) provides interfaces for interacting with elements on web pages.

          3. BOM: The Browser Object Model (BOM) provides the browser API for interacting with the web browser.

- We use JavaScript with HTML and CSS to enhance a web pageâ€™s functionality, such as validating forms , creating interactive features, and displaying animated charts, etc.

- When a web page is loaded, i.e. after HTML and CSS have been downloaded, the JavaScript engine in the web browser executes the JavaScript code.

- The JavaScript code then modifies the HTML and CSS to update the user interface dynamically.

- The JavaScript engine is a program that executes JavaScript code.
