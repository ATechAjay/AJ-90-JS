# Variable

- A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

- To create a variable in JavaScript, use the var, let, and const keywords.

### var instead of let

- The var keyword is almost the same as let . It also declares a variable, but in a slightly different, “old-school” way.

- We can also change it as many times as we want:
  When the value is changed, the old data is removed from the variable.

- Variables declared using const are called “constants”. They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would cause an error.

- When a programmer is sure that a variable will never change, they can declare it with const to guarantee and clearly communicate that fact to everyone.
