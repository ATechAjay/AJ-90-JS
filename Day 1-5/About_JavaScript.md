# What is variable

Variable is the essential building block of JavaScript.

We need operators (we will discuss it later) to modify our variables.

Without variable, a piece of code would do the exact same thing every time.

But with variable, a piece of code do something different every time.

# Variable declaration

When we first time create a Variable, we declare it. This process is known as variable declaration.

To declare a variable, we use the let, var and const keyword followed by the variable name.

```JavaScript
let firstName;

// firstName - Variable, that is not initialized yet. So it's default value will be "undefined"
```

> Variable has a special value "undefined" if you have not assigned a value to it.

But we can also assign a value to a variable known as initialization of a variable.

Once we have declared a variable, we can initialize it with a value. To initialize a variable, we specify the variable name, followed by an equals sign ( = ) and a value.

JavaScript allows us to declare two or more variables using a single statement. To separate two variable declarations, we use a comma ( , ) operator.

```JavaScript
// Variable definition

let firstName = "Ajay";

// firstName - Variable Name/Identifier
// "Ajay" - Value
```

> Now, we can use the above defined Variable in our entire program whenever we want.

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that we donâ€™t need to specify the variableâ€™s type in the declaration.

Since JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, we can re-assign a value of a varible of different data type. Although, it is not recommended.

Once we initialize a variable, we can change its value by re-assigning(=) a different value.

```JavaScript
// Variable definition
let firstName = "Ajay";

// firstName - Variable Name/Identifier
// "Ajay" - Value

// re-assign
firstName = "Alex";

// firstName - Variable Name/Identifier
// "Alex" - New value
```

> A variable has no any data type but a value has.

# Undefined VS undeclared variables

An undefined variable is a variable that has been declared but has not been initialized with a value.

An undeclared variable is a variable that has not been declared or defined yet.
If we want to accesss undeclared variable then JavaScript engine will throw an error.

# let, var, & const

A variable definition consists of three parts:

1. Varible definition keyword (let, var, & const)

2. A variable name (eg: firstName)

3. A value (eg: "Ajay")

`let, var and, const` are used for variables that might have new value assigned somewhere in the program.

The `var` keyword is almost the same as let. It also declares a variable, but in a slightly different way. It is recommended to always use the let keyword.

Variables declared using const are called _constants_. They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would cause an error.

These 3 keywords introduce a new concept known as _scope_, which will be discussed later in the week.

> 'const' declarations must be initialized.

| Keyword | Scope  |
| ------- | ------ |
| var     | Global |
| let     | Block  |
| const   | Block  |
